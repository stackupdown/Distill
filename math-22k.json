        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that when I randomly select 3 items from a batch of 10 products (6 good and 4 defective), at least 2 of them are defective. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that probability problems like this often involve combinations because the order in which we select the items doesn't matter. The total number of ways to choose 3 items out of 10 is probably going to be a combination calculation. Let me confirm that. Yeah, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, so that's right.\n\nSo, the total number of possible ways to select 3 items is C(10,3). Let me compute that. The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! \/ (k! * (n - k)!). Plugging in the numbers, C(10,3) = 10! \/ (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) \/ (3 * 2 * 1) = 120. So there are 120 possible ways to choose any 3 items from the batch.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability of having at least 2 defective items. \"At least 2\" means either exactly 2 defective and 1 good, or exactly 3 defective and 0 good. So I need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes for both scenarios and then add them together. Then divide by the total number of outcomes (120) to get the probability.\n\nLet's start with the first case: exactly 2 defective items and 1 good item. \n\nTo find the number of ways to choose 2 defective items from the 4 available, that's C(4,2). Then, multiply that by the number of ways to choose 1 good item from the 6 available, which is C(6,1). \n\nCalculating C(4,2): 4! \/ (2! * 2!) = (4 * 3) \/ (2 * 1) = 6. \n\nCalculating C(6,1): 6! \/ (1! * 5!) = 6. \n\nSo the number of favorable outcomes for exactly 2 defective items is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nNext, the second case: exactly 3 defective items. \n\nHere, we need to choose all 3 items from the 4 defective ones. So that's C(4,3). \n\nCalculating C(4,3): 4! \/ (3! * 1!) = (4 * 3 * 2) \/ (3 * 2 * 1) = 4. \n\nSo there are 4 ways to choose 3 defective items. \n\nAdding both cases together, the total number of favorable outcomes is 36 + 4 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 40 \/ 120. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 40: 1\/3. Wait, 40 divided by 40 is 1, and 120 divided by 40 is 3. So the probability is 1\/3.\n\nHold on, let me check my calculations again to be sure. Sometimes it's easy to mix up combination numbers.\n\nTotal combinations: C(10,3) = 120. That seems right. For exactly 2 defective and 1 good: C(4,2) is 6, C(6,1) is 6, 6*6=36. For exactly 3 defective: C(4,3)=4. Total favorable: 36+4=40. 40\/120=1\/3. That looks correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using probabilities step by step instead of combinations. Let's see.\n\nThe probability of selecting 3 items with at least 2 defective ones is the same as the sum of the probabilities of exactly 2 defective and exactly 3 defective.\n\nFor exactly 2 defective, the probability would be [C(4,2)*C(6,1)] \/ C(10,3) = 36\/120, which is 3\/10. For exactly 3 defective, it's [C(4,3)*C(6,0)] \/ C(10,3) = 4\/120 = 1\/30. Then, adding those together: 3\/10 + 1\/30 = 9\/30 + 1\/30 = 10\/30 = 1\/3. Yep, same result. \n\nAnother way to verify is to compute the complementary probability, but since \"at least 2 defective\" is not easily complementable, maybe not. Wait, actually, the complement of \"at least 2 defective\" is \"at most 1 defective\". So maybe if I compute 1 - P(0 defective) - P(1 defective), I should get the same answer. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, P(0 defective) is the probability that all 3 items are good. That would be C(6,3)\/C(10,3). C(6,3) is 20, so 20\/120 = 1\/6.\n\nThen, P(1 defective) is [C(4,1)*C(6,2)] \/ C(10,3). C(4,1)=4, C(6,2)=15. So 4*15=60. 60\/120=1\/2.\n\nSo total of complement is 1\/6 + 1\/2 = 1\/6 + 3\/6 = 4\/6 = 2\/3. Therefore, 1 - 2\/3 = 1\/3. That's the same answer. \n\nSo all methods lead to 1\/3. Therefore, the probability is 1\/3.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap once more. The key steps are:\n\n1. Identify total combinations: C(10,3)=120.\n\n2. Calculate favorable combinations for exactly 2 defective (C(4,2)*C(6,1)=6*6=36) and exactly 3 defective (C(4,3)=4).\n\n3. Add them: 36+4=40.\n\n4. Divide by total: 40\/120=1\/3.\n\nAlternatively, using complement method, subtract the probabilities of 0 and 1 defective from 1, also arriving at 1\/3.\n\nAll checks confirm that the answer is 1\/3. Therefore, the probability is 1\/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.\n<\/think>\n\nTo find the probability that there are at least 2 defective items when 3 items are randomly selected from a batch of 10 products (6 good and 4 defective), we use combinations to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n1. **Total number of ways to select 3 items from 10:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of favorable outcomes for exactly 2 defective and 1 good item:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{1} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} \\times \\frac{6!}{1!5!} = 6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of favorable outcomes for exactly 3 defective items:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total number of favorable outcomes:**\n   \\[\n   36 + 4 = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{120} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\nVerification using the complementary probability method confirms the result.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that when I randomly select 3 items from a batch of 10 products (6 good, 4 defective), there are at least 2 defective ones. Hmm, let's see. Alright, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem. There are 10 products in total: 6 are good, 4 are defective. We select 3 at random, and we want the probability that at least 2 of those 3 are defective. So \"at least 2\" means either exactly 2 defective and 1 good, or exactly 3 defective and 0 good. Got it.\n\nSince the selection is random, this is a combinatorics problem where I need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of ways to choose 3 items from 10 is given by the combination formula C(10,3). Then, the number of favorable outcomes would be the number of ways to choose 2 defective items from 4 and 1 good item from 6, plus the number of ways to choose 3 defective items from 4 and 0 good items from 6. Then add those two numbers together and divide by C(10,3). That should give the probability.\n\nLet me write that down step by step to keep things clear.\n\nTotal number of ways to select 3 items: C(10,3).\n\nNumber of ways to select exactly 2 defective and 1 good: C(4,2) * C(6,1).\n\nNumber of ways to select exactly 3 defective and 0 good: C(4,3) * C(6,0).\n\nTherefore, the probability is [C(4,2)*C(6,1) + C(4,3)*C(6,0)] \/ C(10,3).\n\nLet me compute these combinations.\n\nFirst, C(10,3) is 10! \/ (3! * (10-3)!) = (10*9*8)\/(3*2*1) = 120. Wait, 10*9*8 is 720, divided by 6 is 120. Yes, that's correct.\n\nC(4,2) is 4! \/ (2! * 2!) = (4*3)\/(2*1) = 6.\n\nC(6,1) is 6.\n\nSo, C(4,2)*C(6,1) = 6*6 = 36.\n\nThen, C(4,3) is 4! \/ (3! * 1!) = 4.\n\nC(6,0) is 1, since there's only one way to choose nothing.\n\nTherefore, C(4,3)*C(6,0) = 4*1 = 4.\n\nAdding those together, the number of favorable outcomes is 36 + 4 = 40.\n\nSo the probability is 40 \/ 120 = 1\/3. Wait, that seems low. Hmm, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 40 divided by 120 is indeed 1\/3. But intuitively, since there are 4 defective out of 10, is 1\/3 a reasonable answer? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the probability using another method to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe hypergeometric distribution applies here. The hypergeometric probability formula is:\n\nP(X = k) = C(K, k) * C(N-K, n-k) \/ C(N, n)\n\nwhere N is the population size (10), K is the number of defective items (4), n is the sample size (3), and k is the number of defective items in the sample.\n\nSo, we need P(X \u2265 2) = P(X=2) + P(X=3).\n\nWhich is exactly what I calculated above. So, that seems consistent.\n\nCalculating again:\n\nC(4,2) = 6, C(6,1) = 6, so 6*6=36.\n\nC(4,3)=4, C(6,0)=1, so 4*1=4.\n\nTotal favorable: 36 + 4 = 40.\n\nTotal possible: C(10,3)=120.\n\n40\/120 = 1\/3 \u2248 0.3333.\n\nBut wait, 4 defective items out of 10. The chance of getting at least 2 defective in 3 draws... maybe 1\/3 is correct. Alternatively, let's compute the probabilities step by step.\n\nAlternatively, using probability trees. But that might get complicated with three draws. Alternatively, compute the probability of exactly 0, 1, 2, 3 defective items and check if they sum to 1.\n\nCompute all possible probabilities:\n\n- P(0 defective): C(4,0)*C(6,3)\/C(10,3) = 1*20\/120 = 20\/120 = 1\/6.\n\n- P(1 defective): C(4,1)*C(6,2)\/C(10,3) = 4*15\/120 = 60\/120 = 1\/2.\n\n- P(2 defective): 36\/120 = 3\/10.\n\n- P(3 defective): 4\/120 = 1\/30.\n\nNow sum all these probabilities: 1\/6 + 1\/2 + 3\/10 + 1\/30.\n\nConvert to 30 denominators:\n\n1\/6 = 5\/30\n\n1\/2 = 15\/30\n\n3\/10 = 9\/30\n\n1\/30 = 1\/30\n\nTotal: 5 +15 +9 +1 = 30\/30 = 1. Good, that checks out.\n\nSo P(at least 2 defective) = P(2) + P(3) = 3\/10 + 1\/30 = 9\/30 + 1\/30 = 10\/30 = 1\/3. Yep, same answer.\n\nTherefore, 1\/3 is indeed the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, if I use another approach. Let me think about it in terms of conditional probabilities.\n\nFirst, probability that the first two are defective and the third is either defective or good.\n\nWait, but that might be more complex. Because the order matters here. Since in combinations, order doesn't matter. So maybe this approach would require considering all possible orders.\n\nBut let's see. The probability of exactly 2 defective and 1 good. How many ways can this happen in sequence?\n\nThere are C(3,2) = 3 different orders: D D G, D G D, G D D.\n\nEach of these has the same probability.\n\nProbability of D D G: (4\/10)*(3\/9)*(6\/8) = (4*3*6)\/(10*9*8) = 72\/720.\n\nSimilarly for D G D: (4\/10)*(6\/9)*(3\/8) = same as above.\n\nAnd G D D: (6\/10)*(4\/9)*(3\/8) = same numerator, denominator same: 72\/720.\n\nSo total for exactly 2 defective: 3*(72\/720) = 216\/720 = 3\/10. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nFor exactly 3 defective: only one order D D D.\n\nProbability: (4\/10)*(3\/9)*(2\/8) = 24\/720 = 1\/30. Also matches.\n\nSo total probability: 3\/10 + 1\/30 = 10\/30 = 1\/3. Same answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the probability is 1\/3. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the combination calculations once again.\n\nC(4,2) is 6, correct. C(6,1) is 6, correct. So 6*6=36.\n\nC(4,3)=4, C(6,0)=1, so 4*1=4. 36+4=40. 40\/120=1\/3. Yep, all steps check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is supposed to be something else, but I don't see where I could have messed up. Maybe if there was a misinterpretation of the problem? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"There is a batch of products, among which there are 6 good ones and 4 defective ones. If 3 items are randomly selected, the probability that there are at least 2 defective items is _____.\"\n\nNope, that's exactly as I understood. 6 good, 4 defective, total 10. Select 3, probability at least 2 defective. So the answer is 1\/3.\n\nAlternatively, converting that to a reduced fraction or a decimal. 1\/3 is approximately 0.3333. But the question says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", likely as a fraction. So 1\/3.\n\nBut let me check once again with another method. Maybe using probabilities step by step without combinations.\n\nProbability of exactly 2 defective:\n\nFirst, pick two defective and one good. The number of ways this can happen is, as we considered before, 3 different orders. Each order has probability (4\/10)(3\/9)(6\/8). Let's compute that:\n\n(4\/10)(3\/9)(6\/8) = (4*3*6)\/(10*9*8) = 72\/720 = 1\/10.\n\nWait, but there are 3 orders, so 3*(1\/10) = 3\/10. Which is the same as before.\n\nProbability of exactly 3 defective:\n\n(4\/10)(3\/9)(2\/8) = 24\/720 = 1\/30.\n\nSo total is 3\/10 + 1\/30 = 10\/30 = 1\/3. Same result.\n\nAlright, I think that's solid. So the answer is 1\/3. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So I will go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.\n<\/think>\n\nTo find the probability that there are at least 2 defective items when 3 items are randomly selected from a batch of 10 products (6 good, 4 defective), we need to consider the combinations of selecting items.\n\n1. **Total number of ways to select 3 items from 10:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways to select exactly 2 defective and 1 good item:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{1} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} \\times 6 = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} \\times 6 = 6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of ways to select exactly 3 defective items:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{6}{0} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} \\times 1 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total number of favorable outcomes:**\n   \\[\n   36 + 4 = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{120} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that there are at least 2 defective items is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}."

So there are 120 possible ways to choose any 3 items from the batch.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability of having at least 2 defective items. \"At least 2\" means either exactly 2 defective and 1 good, or exactly 3 defective and 0 good.

So that's C(4,3). \n\nCalculating C(4,3): 4! \/ (3! * 1!) = (4 * 3 * 2) \/ (3 * 2 * 1) = 4. \n\nSo there are 4 ways to choose 3 defective items. \n\nAdding both cases together, the total number of favorable outcomes is 36 + 4 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: 40 \/ 120.
